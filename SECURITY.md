## Security Architecture Overview

`nodulus-core` is a **build-time and bootstrap-time structural layer** for Express.js applications. It is not a web server, authentication provider, or network-facing service. Its attack surface is confined to:

- The developer's local filesystem during `createApp()` bootstrap.
- The `nodulus check` CLI command during CI/CD analysis.
- The NITS registry file (`.nodulus/registry.json`) written to and read from disk.
- Node.js ESM Hooks registered at runtime for alias resolution.

No user-supplied HTTP request data flows through this library at runtime.

---

## Security Properties by Component

### 1. ESM Alias Resolver (`src/aliases/resolver.ts`)

The alias resolver hooks into the Node.js module resolution pipeline via `node:module`'s `register()` API (requires Node.js ≥ 20.6.0).

**Protections in place:**

- All alias targets are **normalized to absolute paths** during registration, eliminating path-traversal risks from relative aliases containing `../` sequences.
- Alias registration is **content-addressable (idempotent)**: a SHA-based hash of the serialized alias map is stored in `registeredHashes`. Duplicate calls to `createApp()` with the same aliases do not re-register hooks, preventing race conditions in hot-reload scenarios.
- A **singleton promise pattern** (`_registrationPromise`) ensures that concurrent activations from asynchronous bootstrap paths converge safely.
- User-defined aliases always override auto-generated `@modules/*` aliases, providing a predictable priority order that prevents shadowing attacks within the local codebase.

**Known limitation:**

> This resolver is strictly for Node.js ESM pipelines. CJS environments and bundlers (Vite, esbuild) must use `getAliases()` to configure their own resolvers. Passing a CJS project will cause an early `INVALID_ESM_ENV` error before any alias logic executes.

---

### 2. Bootstrap Pipeline (`src/bootstrap/createApp.ts`)

`createApp()` is the main entry point. It orchestrates configuration loading, module discovery, NITS reconciliation, and Express router mounting.

**Protections in place:**

- **Duplicate bootstrap guard:** The function checks for a `__nodulusBootstrapped` flag on the Express `app` object before proceeding. A second call with the same instance throws `DUPLICATE_BOOTSTRAP` immediately, preventing double-registration of routes or state corruption.
- **ESM environment validation:** The function reads `package.json` to verify `"type": "module"` is present before any module loading occurs. Non-ESM projects fail fast with `INVALID_ESM_ENV`.
- **Strict mode:** When `strict: true` (default in non-production environments), undeclared cross-module imports detected at runtime cause an immediate `UNDECLARED_IMPORT` error, enforcing explicit dependency declaration.
- **NITS as an audit-only layer:** NITS I/O errors (disk failures, corrupted registry) are caught and surfaced as `console.warn` messages. They never abort the Express bootstrap, preventing a corrupted registry file from taking down the application server.
- **No user-controlled input:** `createApp()` reads only from `nodulus.config.ts/js` and the local filesystem. No data from HTTP requests or external network sources is processed.

---

### 3. NITS Registry (`src/nits/nits-store.ts`)

The NITS (Nodulus Integrated Tracking System) assigns stable `mod_{hex8}` identities to modules and persists them to `.nodulus/registry.json`.

**Protections in place:**

- **Strict schema validation on load:** `loadNitsRegistry()` rejects any registry file that does not conform to the expected schema. All seven required fields (`name`, `path`, `hash`, `status`, `createdAt`, `lastSeen`, `identifiers`) are validated per module record. A single malformed record causes the entire registry to be discarded and re-initialized (not partially applied), eliminating partial-corruption scenarios.
- **Module ID format validation:** All keys are validated against the `/^mod_[0-9a-f]{8}$/` regex via `isValidModuleId()`. Records with keys that do not match this format are rejected. This prevents injection of arbitrary strings as module identifiers.
- **Version mismatch warning:** If the registry `version` field does not match `NITS_REGISTRY_VERSION`, a warning is emitted. The registry is still loaded (non-breaking), but operators are notified of the schema drift.
- **Atomic writes:** `saveNitsRegistry()` uses a write-then-rename strategy (`registry.json.tmp` → `registry.json`). This ensures the registry is never left in a partially written state even if the process is killed mid-write.
- **Immutable `createdAt` timestamps:** The `createdAt` field is set once on module creation and never overwritten by the reconciler, providing a tamper-evident creation timestamp for each module identity.
- **Clone before save:** The registry object is cloned before being written to disk to prevent accidental mutation of the in-memory object after the save call returns.

**File should be committed to Git:**

> The `_note` field in the registry file explicitly instructs teams to include `.nodulus/registry.json` in version control. Omitting it from Git would cause all module IDs to be regenerated on every fresh clone, defeating the purpose of stable identity tracking.

---

### 4. CLI Analyzer (`src/cli/commands/check.ts`)

The `nodulus check` command performs static AST analysis of the project's source files to detect architectural violations.

**Protections in place:**

- **AST-based analysis only:** The CLI uses `acorn` for parsing. It reads source files from the local filesystem and does not execute them. No `eval()` or dynamic code execution occurs during analysis.
- **Transient file-lock resilience:** File-locking incidents encountered during batch analysis (e.g., from concurrent editors or other processes) are handled gracefully. The pipeline emits a warning and continues rather than crashing (`CLI_ERROR` is caught and reported cleanly).
- **Graph ID mapping fix:** A legacy bug (N-34) where the CLI improperly looked up module IDs by name instead of NITS ID has been fixed in v1.4.0, eliminating a class of identity mapping failures that could cause incorrect violation attribution.
- **`--strict` mode for CI:** When `--strict` is passed, the command exits with code `1` on any violation, enabling hard-gate CI/CD pipelines.
- **`--format json`:** Machine-readable output avoids log injection risks from unescaped module names in terminal output.

---

### 5. Configuration Loading (`src/core/config.ts`)

**Protections in place:**

- Configuration files (`nodulus.config.ts` / `nodulus.config.js`) are loaded from the **current working directory only**. There is no mechanism to load configuration from a remote URL or an arbitrary filesystem path.
- If a `.ts` config file is found in an environment that cannot transpile TypeScript (e.g., production without a loader), the error message explicitly instructs the operator to use a compiled `.js` config or run with `tsx`/`ts-node`. This prevents silent misconfiguration.
- The merge strategy (`options > fileConfig > defaults`) ensures that programmatic options passed to `createApp()` always take precedence over file-based configuration, preventing a malicious config file from overriding a security-sensitive programmatic setting.

---

### 6. Registry Isolation (`src/core/registry.ts`)

- The in-memory module registry is scoped to each `createApp()` call via `AsyncLocalStorage`. This ensures complete isolation between concurrent requests or test runs sharing the same Node.js process.
- **Duplicate name detection:** `registerModule()` validates for name uniqueness *before* mutating internal maps (fixed in v1.4.0 via REGLA-14). A duplicate module name throws `DUPLICATE_MODULE` before any state is written, preventing silent registry overwrites.
- **Internal API surface:** The `InternalRegistry` interface (with mutators like `clearRegistry()`) is explicitly marked `@internal` and not exported from the public `src/index.ts` surface.

---

## Known Security Considerations and Limitations

### Alias Path Injection via `nodulus.config`

Since Nodulus loads `nodulus.config.ts/js` as a native ESM module, a **malicious config file** could theoretically execute arbitrary code during `createApp()`. This is an accepted risk inherent to all config-as-code patterns (similar to `vite.config.ts`, `webpack.config.js`, etc.). Mitigation lies outside the library scope: treat your project's config files as trusted code and review them like any other source file.

### Registry File Tampering

The `.nodulus/registry.json` file is validated on load but is not cryptographically signed. A developer with write access to the repository could manually forge module IDs or timestamps. This is mitigated by the strict `isValidRegistry` and `isValidModuleId` checks, which will reject obviously malformed records, but a carefully crafted valid-looking forgery could be accepted. This is considered acceptable for a developer-tooling package.

### `Controller` Excluded from Semantic Hashing (BUG-1, fixed in v1.4.0)

Prior to v1.4.0, the `Controller` identifier was included in the NITS semantic hash, causing HTTP route paths (e.g., `"/users"`) to be stored as module identifiers. This produced Jaccard = 1.0 false positives between unrelated modules sharing route prefixes, potentially causing NITS to assign the wrong stable ID to a module after a rename. **Fixed in v1.4.0** by removing `Controller` from `targetCallees`; only `Service`, `Repository`, and `Schema` are now semantic identity carriers.

### Node.js Minimum Version

Nodulus requires **Node.js ≥ 20.6.0** for the `--import` flag and native ESM Hooks API (`node:module` `register()`). Running on older Node.js versions will fail at the ESM environment validation step. Ensure your deployment infrastructure and CI pipeline enforce this minimum.

### ESM-Only

Nodulus dropped CommonJS support in v1.0.0. Projects attempting to use Nodulus in a CJS context will receive an `INVALID_ESM_ENV` error immediately. There is no CJS compatibility shim, and none is planned.
